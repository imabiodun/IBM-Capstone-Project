In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans. 
The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. 
It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories. 
Finding an optimal location for building a launch site certainly involves many factors and hopefully we could discover some of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations.





**Objectives**
##### This lab contains the following tasks:

TASK 1: Mark all launch sites on a map
TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
TASK 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities
